# Q Music Player Root Repo
This is a repo-of-repos available for install by default on a new un-configured <a href="https://qmusicplayer.com" target="_blank">Q Music Player</a>. Each entry on this list is a *repo*. A repo in turn is a list of *apps* available for the Q. Each app-entry contains information about an app and a *direct download link* which can point to anywhere (local, intranet, internet...).

## Repos
All included repos are listed in [repos.json](./repos.json). The ones maintained by us are:
 * [q-repo](https://github.com/plundell/q-repo) - Only contains apps made by us - **1st party**.
 * [q-repo-official](https://github.com/plundell/q-repo-official) - For legal entities wishing to publish their **official** apps - **3rd party**
 * [q-repo-unofficial](https://github.com/plundell/q-repo-unofficial) - *Anybody* can add *any* app to this repo. Use at own peril - **3rd party**


## 3rd Party Apps
Users can install any app they please on their Q, either by providing a direct download link for said app, or by searching/browsing a repo they've previously added, ie. if you're a developer you need to get that information to the user somehow, you could:

**a)** Add your repo to this list-of-repos by [emailing us](mailto:qmusicplayer@protonmail.com)  
**b)** Add your app to one of the repos listed here, again by [emailing us](mailto:qmusicplayer@protonmail.com)

A more sofisticated system of submission is on our todo list.
