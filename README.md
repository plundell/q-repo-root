# Q Music Player Main Repos
This is a list-of-repos available for install by default on a new un-configured <a href="https://qmusicplayer.com" target="_blank">Q Music Player</a>. Each entry on this list is a *repo*. A repo in turn is a list of *apps* available for the Q. Each app-entry contains information about an app and a *direct download link* which can point to anywhere (local, intranet, internet...). Our goal at Q is to give the power back to the end user, to which end you can install [3rd party apps](#3rd-party-apps).

## Repos

## 3rd Party Apps
Users can install any app they please on their Q, either by providing a direct download link for said app, or by searching/browsing a repo they've previously added, ie. if you're a developer you need to get that information to the user somehow, you could:
#### Add your repo to this list-of-repos
1. Fork
2. Change repos.json
3. Make a pull request

#### Add your app to one of the repos listed here
